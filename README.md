# rancher-desktop-calico-policies

I avoided using the built-in Kubernetes component of Rancher Desktop. <br/>
I unchecked this option and switched the container runtime from ```containerd``` to ```dockerd```:

## Install KinD

KinD offers a lot of customization like using another CNI component like Calico for CNI and network policies instead of relying on the built-in one <br/>
If you want to use KinD on Rancher Desktop for Kubernetes, make sure you are always using the latest release. Itâ€™s ```v0.12.0``` at the time of writing

```
cd desktop
```

```
mkdir rancher-desktop
```

```
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.12.0/kind-darwin-amd64
```

```
chmod +x ./kind
```
